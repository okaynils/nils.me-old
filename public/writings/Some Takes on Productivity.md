# Some Takes on Productivity

This is my collection of personal takes on optimizing productivity. There are a lot of people with productivity notes on their personal websites - one of my favorite is that of 
[Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity).

The term **productivity** has, over the years, morphed into a buzzword that's alluring and paradoxically misleading. As we've witnessed a surge in "lifestyle gurus" championing 
the cause of productivity, the essence of what it means to be genuinely productive has become muddled. I aim to peel back these layers, and share some straightforward, no-nonsense 
tips that have genuinely worked for me.

## Stop reading news
Step back from the news cycle, particularly the **political whirlwind**. The truth is, the vast majority of it isn't crucial to your daily life. If anything of real significance 
were to happen on the political front, trust me, you'll find out one way or another without having to dig through the news yourself. There's a widespread push by numerous powerful 
entities and systems to hook you on a constant stream of outrage or the **illusion of being 'up-to-date' with the latest drama**, especially in the U.S. context or the western 
world in general. It's not to say that all news sources are cut from the same cloth â€” I'm specifically pointing fingers at some of the mainstream websites that many folks find 
themselves scrolling through, getting worked up over the day's controversies. That said, there are countless specialized websites and online communities out there that are 
genuinely enriching and worth your time.

## Avoid the Pitfalls of Diminishing Returns
Many activities become less rewarding the more you do them. For example, checking X (Twitter) or Reddit after not doing so for a while can be interesting, but if you keep checking 
them constantly, you'll find less and less value each time. It's important to notice when you're spending too much time on something that's **no longer beneficial** and think about 
switching to a different activity.

It's helpful to have a list of quick activities ready for short breaks throughout your day. People often turn to social media, email, or messaging apps during these times. 
A good alternative I've found is reviewing flashcards on my Anki deck. This activity is flexible because you can start and stop any time, and it's still useful, even if you 
only have a few minutes.

## To Optimize Sleep
I have struggled with bed-time procrastination since middle-school until I noticed that **it's important to value sleep over extra work** in the long run because the benefits of 
good sleep **outweigh the time it takes**.

Investing time, effort, and possibly money into enhancing your sleep can have a very high return on investment. Making your sleeping environment quieter, darker, and a bit cooler 
can make a significant difference. Tracking your sleep with devices like an Oura ring can also be helpful if you want detailed insights. It's best to avoid consuming alcoholic 
drinks or eating right before bed, as these can negatively affect your sleep: There is a great [podcast episode from Andrew Huberman](https://youtu.be/FFwA0QFmpQ4?si=1VJ88HNGO_tktN6h&t=3734) 
on this. In short: Drinking alcohol will prevent you from reaching REM state (deep sleep).

## Drugs and Supplements
In this section I want to touch on how drugs like **Caffeine** can actually help you stay productive. Caffeine is well-known, so little needs to be said here about what it does 
or how it works. There are few downsides, many upsides, and it is legal and socially encouraged. It is still a drug, however, so side-effects and tolerance are possible. Generally, what
your goal should be is to not let your consumption of such drugs/supplements creep up more. I personally drink one cup of coffee a day and it's enough to feel the effects of caffeine
for an entire afternoon. For the most effective and healthy consumption make sure to drink your first cup of coffee around **90 minutes after waking up**. Your last cup should be
**8 hours before bedtime** to **not interrupt your sleep**.
